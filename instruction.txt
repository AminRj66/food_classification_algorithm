To run the code, proceed as follows:

1- Install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
2- Put the test images related to each class in the folders named as that class label in the path "data/test" (the same as the training dataset).
3- Run the main.py file.
4- Accuracy value will be printed on the screen. There also visualizes a figure for the confusion matrix at the end.

Hint1: The training dataset is empty uploaded because for testing the saved model there is no further need for that and clearly requires just testing dataset. 
Hint2: One image is left in each image label folder in data/test path just to make it possible to push into github, you can remove that single image and put your testing images into each test folder.
